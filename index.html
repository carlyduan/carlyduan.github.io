		By u/mybossdaughter

Earlyer this day I was shopping groceries during break, wearing my suit (nothing special, just plain black business suit). So I'm waiting in line with 3 items (some candy&pie&coffee for the office staff, shit hit the fan yesterday), a ~30 y.o. woman in front of me lets me pass her.
<br>
After I said thanks and smiled at her for her kindness (here in Germany we don't say thanks so often like in the U.S./G.B) she added: "It would be a shame if I wasted your valuable time, yuppie! Go and buy something nice and expensive from all the money you make!"
<br>
I really didn't do anything to offend her or anybody else.
<br>
So my question is: Is this just envy or what is the reason for such anger?

	MEDIA POLL uses online news databases to measure media trends, coverage 
of current events, and the news organizations that cover them.  The Media 
Poll delves deep into the data warehouses of vast, electronic news 
archives, presses a few buttons and throws a few switches, and then steps 
back--ultimately attempting to make sense of the "findings," whether any 
sense is there to be made or not.  Sometimes, the "findings" just speak 
for themselves.
<br><br><br>
This book includes three articles from the 1990s Mediapoll magazine, At the same time, it also includes some current corresponding topic.
