	MEDIA POLL uses online news databases to measure media trends, coverage 
of current events, and the news organizations that cover them.  The Media 
Poll delves deep into the data warehouses of vast, electronic news 
archives, presses a few buttons and throws a few switches, and then steps 
back--ultimately attempting to make sense of the "findings," whether any 
sense is there to be made or not.  Sometimes, the "findings" just speak 
for themselves.

This book includes three articles from the 1990s Mediapoll magazine, At the same time, it also includes some current corresponding topic.
