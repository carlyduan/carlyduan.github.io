Earlyer this day I was shopping groceries during break, wearing my suit (nothing special, just plain black business suit). So I'm waiting in line with 3 items (some candy&pie&coffee for the office staff, shit hit the fan yesterday), a ~30 y.o. woman in front of me lets me pass her.
<br>
After I said thanks and smiled at her for her kindness (here in Germany we don't say thanks so often like in the U.S./G.B) she added: "It would be a shame if I wasted your valuable time, yuppie! Go and buy something nice and expensive from all the money you make!"
<br>
I really didn't do anything to offend her or anybody else.
<br>
So my question is: Is this just envy or what is the reason for such anger?
