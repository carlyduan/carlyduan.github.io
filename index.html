Earlyer this day I was shopping groceries during break, wearing my suit (nothing special, just plain black business suit). So I'm waiting in line with 3 items (some candy&pie&coffee for the office staff, shit hit the fan yesterday), a ~30 y.o. woman in front of me lets me pass her.
<br>
After I said thanks and smiled at her for her kindness (here in Germany we don't say thanks so often like in the U.S./G.B) she added: "It would be a shame if I wasted your valuable time, yuppie! Go and buy something nice and expensive from all the money you make!"
<br>
I really didn't do anything to offend her or anybody else.
<br>
So my question is: Is this just envy or what is the reason for such anger?Earlyer this day I was shopping groceries during break, wearing my suit (nothing special, just plain black business suit).

		By John Marcus

		<br><br>

This week's "poll" was prompted by a reader who suggested we follow up on her impression that an unusually high number of articles about the Internet seem to focus on "certain negative, sensationalist topics" such as "sex, pedophiles, terrorists, and censorship."  The media, if this is true, seems capable of only finding the bad stuff interesting, making the Internet Story one where crime and/or prurience meet data communications in the ultimate unholy tryst of convenience.

		<br><br>

After serving nine years for armed robbery, O.J. Simpson is out on parole, living in borrowed luxury, and swamped with selfie-seeking fans and business proposals. Yet he’s also a fugitive—from Fred Goldman, who’s still determined to make Simpson pay, literally, for the 1994 killing of his son, Ron. Mark Seal chronicles this latest chapter in the increasingly surreal O.J. saga.
